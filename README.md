# compute-sdk-go

Experimental Go SDK for building [Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless) applications with [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/).

## Quick Start

The Fastly Developer Hub has a great [Quick Start guide for Go](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/go/).

Alternatively, you can take a look at the [Go Starter Kit](https://github.com/fastly/compute-starter-kit-go-default).

You'll also want to take a look at our [Recommended Packages](#recommended-packages) section, as this can help with the sharp edges of the SDK, like JSON support.

## Installation

First, install TinyGo by following the [TinyGo Quick install guide](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/).

Then, you can install `compute-sdk-go` in your project by running:

`go get github.com/fastly/compute-sdk-go`

## Examples

Examples can be found in the [`examples`](./_examples) directory.

The Fastly Developer Hub has a collection of [common use cases in VCL ported to TinyGo](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/migrate/). Which also acts as a great set of introductory examples of using TinyGo on Compute@Edge.

## API Reference

The API reference documentation can be found on [pkg.go.dev/github.com/fastly/compute-sdk-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fastly/compute-sdk-go).

## Logging

Logging can be done using a Fastly Compute@Edge Log Endpoint ([example](./_examples/logging-and-env/main.go)), or by using normal stdout like:

```
fmt.Printf("request received: %s\n", r.URL.String())
```

## Recommended Packages

TinyGo is still a new project, which has yet to get a version `1.0.0`. Therefore, the project is incomplete, but in its current state can still handle a lot of tasks on Compute@Edge. However, [some languages features of Go are still missing](https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/lang-support/).

To help with your adoption of `compute-sdk-go`, here are some recommended packages to help with some of the current missing language features:

### JSON Parsing

TinyGo's  `reflect` support (which is needed by `encoding/json` among other things) is still new. While most use cases should work, for performance or other compatibility reasons you might need to consider a third-party JSON package if the standard library doesn't meet your needs.

* [buger/jsonparser](https://github.com/buger/jsonparser)
